/// `FragmentedKeyManager` is the central class in the FragmentedKeys library.
/// It's responsible for managing key rings and their associated tags, ensuring that caching and invalidation are handled efficiently.
///
/// The manager uses an `Environment` instance to access shared resources like settings and storage managers,
/// providing a unified approach to cache management across the application.
///
/// Usage:
/// This class is typically accessed via its shared instance and used to create and manage key rings.

    // MARK: - Key Ring Management

    // Here you can add methods to create, manage, and use key rings for cache management.

    // Example:
    // func createKeyRing(withTags tags: [BaseTag]) -> KeyRing { ... }

    // MARK: - Cache Operations

    // Methods to perform caching operations using key rings can be added here.

    // Example:
    // func fetchCachedData(for keyRing: KeyRing) -> CachedData? { ... }
}

// MARK: - Extension
// Additional functionalities or helper methods for FragmentedKeyManager can be added here.
